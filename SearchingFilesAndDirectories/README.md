# Searching files and directories

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Use `find` for powerful, real-time searches, while `locate` is faster but requires database updates.

## Using `locate`

The `locate` command searches for files using a pre-built database, making it very fast.

- Find a file by name:
  ```bash
  locate test.txt  # Searches for all files named test.txt
  ```
- Update the locate database (run as root if needed):
  ```bash
  sudo updatedb  # Updates the database for accurate results
  ```

## Using `find`

The `find` command searches files and directories in real-time based on different criteria.

- Basic search:
  ```bash
  find  # Lists all files and directories from the current location
  ```
- Find files by name:
  ```bash
  find ~/Desktop -name "*.txt"  # Finds all .txt files in the Desktop folder
  ```
- Exclude certain files using `-not`:
  ```bash
  find -type f -not -name "*.txt"  # Finds all files except .txt files
  ```
- Find empty files or directories:
  ```bash
  find -empty  # Lists all empty files and directories
  ```

## Using `find` with `xargs`

The `xargs` command helps execute actions on search results.

- List all empty files and directories using `ls`:
  ```bash
  find -empty | xargs ls  # Runs ls on each empty file or directory
  ```
- Delete all `.log` files interactively (the -i option prompts before deletion):
  ```bash
  find ~/logs -name "*.log" | xargs rm -i
  ```
